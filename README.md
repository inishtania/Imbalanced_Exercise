# ✨Imbalanced Data Handling for Classification Models✨

Building an effective classification model requires careful consideration of the metrics used to evaluate its performance. While accuracy is a straightforward metric, it can be misleading when dealing with imbalanced datasets. High accuracy might mask poor performance on minority classes, which is why preprocessing techniques are essential for improving model performance on imbalanced data.
<br>
In this project, I will demonstrate various methods to handle imbalanced datasets, including:
<br>
1. Undersampling
2. Oversampling
3. NearMiss
4. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
5. Optimized Thresholding

## About the Project
As a data scientist at a renowned hospital, I am tasked with predicting whether an individual is at risk of experiencing a stroke. The goal is to accurately classify patients as either stroke or non-stroke cases.
<br>

### Steps Taken:

1. **Understanding the Business Problem**: Define the goal and the evaluation method for our model.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicates, and any hidden data that need modifications.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze each feature and examine relationships or correlations between them.
4. **Model Selection and Cross-Validation**: Test basic models such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree using cross-validation.
5. **Manual Treatment of Imbalanced Data**: Apply various imbalance treatment methods to understand their effects.
6. **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters automatically.
7. **Confusion Matrix Analysis**: Evaluate model performance using the confusion matrix, focusing on improvements in False Positives and False Negatives.

## Final Results

After extensive experimentation, Logistic Regression emerged as the most effective model. Random Oversampling proved to be the best method for handling the imbalanced dataset. Post-treatment, the model showed significant improvement in classification performance.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the importance of handling imbalanced datasets properly to ensure reliable model performance. By using appropriate preprocessing techniques and thorough evaluation, we can develop models that provide more accurate and actionable predictions.
